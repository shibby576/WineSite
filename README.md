# WineSite: Deploy a ML model to production

My main goal with this project was understand how ML models can be deployed into production. In addtition, while I had developed static web pages in the past, I had never built/deployed a website in a full stack capacity, so my goal is to build an applicatition from the ground up that includes a ML model. 

Problem: As a novice wine enthusist, I thought it would be nice to have a tool that could save me the embarrasment of staring at shelves of wine, searching for a "good one" at my local wine shop. 

Solution: Something that could predict the quality of wine based on attributes i can see at the store might save me.

Learning objectives:
<br>-How to deploy a basic ML model in production 
<br>-How to deploy a website
<br>-Build a basic web app with python and html/css

Technology, products & methods used:
<br>-Data analysis in Python (Pandas, numpy, Matplotlib) 
<br>-Model training and testing with Python (Scikit-learn)
<br>-Python for application code (Flask)
<br>-HTML/CSS for front end (Bootstrap)
<br>-Heroku for app hosting
