# WineSite: Deploy a ML model to production

My main goal with this project was understand how ML models can be deployed into production. In addtition, while I had developed static web pages in the past, I had never built/deployed a website in a full stack capacity, so my goal is to build an applicatition from the ground up that includes a ML model. 

Learning objectives:
-How to deploy a basic ML model in production 
-How to deploy a website
-Build a basic web app with python and html/css

Technology, products & methods used:
Data analysis in Python (Pandas, numpy, Matplotlib) 
Model training and testing with Python (Scikit-learn)
Python for application code (Flask)
HTML/CSS for front end (Bootstrap)
Heroku for app hosting
