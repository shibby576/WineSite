# Learn how to deploy a ML model to production

Most of my personal experince with building and training models has been in an explority sense, building models in Jupyter notebooks, which were never really useful to end users. I wanted to understand how to take this more theoretical experince and apply it in a practical way, understanding the requirements and challenges of building a full stack application that leverages machine learning. To do this, I set out to solve a personal problem a simple web application that leverages a basic ML model.

In addtition, while I had developed static web pages in the past, I had never built/deployed a website in a full stack capacity, so this project also pushed me to learn the fundamentals of web development.

Problem: As a novice wine enthusist, I thought it would be nice to have a tool that could save me the embarrasment of staring at shelves of wine, searching for a "good one" at my local wine shop. 

Solution: Something that could predict the quality of wine based on attributes i can see at the store might save me.
